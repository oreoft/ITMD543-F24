### Lab1 - [Link](lab-1)

This project is a demonstration of automatic deployment of a static page using GitHub and Azure. It contains sample code
for a self-introduction page, primarily aimed at verifying the deployment process. The repository showcases how code
pushed to GitHub can automatically trigger a build and deploy process, seamlessly integrating development with
deployment.

Please visit the Lab1 [Link](lab-1) to see more details.

### Lab2 - [Link](lab-2)

This lab demonstrates the use of Semantic HTML, CSS for styling (CSS packages allowed, but no frontend frameworks like
React or Vue.js), and JavaScript for interactivity. The main requirement is to display a subset of data based on user
selections, such as selecting categories from a list or checkbox.
